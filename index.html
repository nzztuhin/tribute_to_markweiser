            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Weiser was born in Harvey, Illinois to David W. Weiser and Audra H. Weiser. He was a descendant of Conrad Weiser. Weiser entered New College of Florida in 1970, but did not remain at that institution to graduate. He studied Computer and Communication Science at the University of Michigan, receiving an M.A. in 1977 and a Ph.D. in 1979. He was known to comment that he bypassed the bachelor's degree on the way to his Ph.D. He then spent eight years teaching in the University of Maryland Department of Computer Science.</p>
            <p>While Weiser worked for a variety of computer related startups, his seminal work was in the field of ubiquitous computing while leading the computer science laboratory at PARC, which he joined in 1987. His ideas were significantly influenced by his father's reading of Michael Polanyi's "The Tacit Dimension". He became head of the computer science laboratory in 1988 and chief technology officer in 1996, authoring more than eighty technical publications.</p>
            <h2>Ubiquitous computing and calm technology</h2>
            <p>During one of his talks, Weiser outlined a set of principles describing ubiquitous computing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The purpose of a computer is to help you do something else.</li>
                <li>The best computer is a quiet, invisible servant.</li>
                <li>The more you can do by intuition the smarter you are; the computer should extend your unconscious.</li>
                <li>Technology should create calm.</li>
            </ul>
